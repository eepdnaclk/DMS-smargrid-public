# DMS-smartgrid-public
This is the public repository of the DMS-smartgrid [repo](https://github.com/eepdnaclk/DMS-smartgrid).


## Distribution Management System
This is the codebase of the 3 bus network DMS built in lab to test previous pdnsmartgrid researches(Centralised PQ control, [State estimation](https://github.com/eepdnaclk/state_estimation-smartgrid) and [PV rephasing](https://github.com/eepdnaclk/PV_rephasing-smartgrid)) on voltage violation/voltage unbalance mitigation in Low Voltage(LV) grids due to increases PV penetration.

## The line model
The line model used in the lab for the emulation process is shown in the figure below.
